The first idea behind tag1thing is similar to an e-mail account to store my important online documents.

Sometimes when I find a news article I like, I will mail it to my news-article-gmail-account.

After several years this account will contain many news articles.

Since these articles are in gmail I can easily find them again.

I'm using gmail as both an index and repository of documents.

One problem with this gmail account is that it is a single point of failure.

If I lose the account to hackers or problems at google, I lose all my news articles.

So, the first use-case to inspire tag1thing is to have a site which allows me to store news articles in many locations.

And tag1thing will act as a private index to these articles so I can easily find them again.

If some of the articles are lost to hackers or problems at google, I will have backup copies.


The second idea behind tag1thing is inspired from Twitter and the Facebook Feed.

Tag1thing will allow me to create public indexes to articles.

These public indexes could be used by me to publicize my ideas to the world.

The third idea behind Tag1thing is to create indexes on other things besides articles.

The indexes could point to any kind of digital content, movies or software for example.


I got distracted by other efforts so tag1thing is currently dormant.

It was dependent on these 2 URLs: tag1thing.com and t1t.us

I let both of those URLs expire.

After expiration, they were quickly grabbed by URL squatters.

An early version of tag1thing is running at this URL:

http://t1t.heroku.com
