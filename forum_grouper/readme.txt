The idea behind http://ForumGrouper.com is to act as an index of posts I make to forums while searching for technical information.

Also this site helps me maintain privacy by helping me track personas I use on the internet while searching for technical information.

The main ideas behind Tag1thing are derived from my ideas behind ForumGrouper.com

ForumGrouper.com allows me to track posts, forums, and personas.

Tag1thing allows me to track any kind of digital information I want to store on the internet.

Much to my surprise, 
http://ForumGrouper.com
is still running.

The domain will expire in December of 2011.

At that point access to it will be from this URL:

http://fg13.heroku.com
