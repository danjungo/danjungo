<h2>Spam</h2>

<br />Are you receiving spam with a return address of someone@ForumGrouper.com?
<br />
<br />If so, It's forged e-mail.
<br />
<br />The domain ForumGrouper.com is configured to prevent spam from being sent.
<br />
<br />If Dan Bikle needs to send e-mail, he uses gmail with
<br />bikle@bikle.com
<br />as a return address.
<br />
<br />If you send e-mail to bikle@bikle.com or ForumGrouper@ForumGrouper.com, it actually gets routed to Google via
an internet mechanism known as an MX record.

<br />
<br />If you have a domain and you want to use Google to receive e-mail for you,
<br />that is an excellent choice.
<br />
<br />Why?
<br />
<br />Google offers an extremely effective self-learning spam filter.
<br />
<br />By itself, it does a good job of filtering spam.
<br />
<br />After a few weeks of watching you (and millions of others)
<br />tag the few spams which do get through, it becomes extremely accurate.
<br />
<br />
<br />The user interface to Google hosted e-mail is identical to gmail.com.
