c1c.me is a short-url-blog site.

Currently the URL is turned off but I did manage to deploy the code at this URL:

http://c1c.heroku.com

Some of the code might depend on the URL http:c1c.me so expect some buggy behavior.

Here is the main idea behind this site; you create blogs here and post
the blog url in your twitter stream.

You start a blog by thinking of a short URL.

For example,

http://c1c.heroku.com/dan

You then type 

http://c1c.heroku.com/dan into your browser.

If no one has taken that URL yet, you will be dropped into a blog editor.

And, c1c.heroku.com/dan will belong to you.

If someone has taken that URL already, you will see their blog post.

In that case you think of a different URL like,

http://c1c.heroku.com/dn


IF YOU ARE NOT LOGGED IN, the blog entry will disappear after a week or so.

During that time, the blog entry will be owned by "Anonymous".

If you are logged in, the blog entry will be permanent and belong to you.

I dislike sites which offer me a registration form as an initial experience.

Any site I deploy defers registration for as long as possible.

I want users to get value from my site before I ask them for value.
