Back in 2009 I called this prject the Bikle Facebook IFrame Demo.

The primary purpose of it was to act as a "starter kit" when I create a new Facebook Application.

Also it was my intention to use it as a tutorial for developers tasked with building a Facebook Application.

Shortly after I finished this project, Facebook made some significant changes to the APIs they expose to developers.

So, I don't consider this code very useful any more.

The code, however, is still deployed at this URL:

http://ffbiframe.heroku.com

Due to the API changes though, the code malfunctions after a few short end-user interactions.
