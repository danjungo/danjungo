edgar411.com was an initial attempt to create a web-based toolkit for pulling numeric data out of these websites:

http://www.sec.gov/
http://www.sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/companysearch.html

The basic idea is to use edgar411.com as a repository of hpricot expressions which could be used as a bridge between English questions about a company and numeric answers.

For example here is a URL to the 2011-06-30 balance sheet for Google:

http://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1288776/000119312511188398/dex992.htm

The above balance sheet could be used to answer the English question:

"What is the unaudited value of total assets owned by Google as of 2011-06-30 ?"

Currently this code is not deployed anywhere.
