</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements of Alnylam Pharmaceuticals, Inc.
(the &#147;Company&#148; or &#147;Alnylam&#148;) are unaudited and have been prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States applicable to interim periods and, in the
opinion of management, include all normal and recurring adjustments that are necessary to present
fairly the results of operations for the reported periods. The Company&#146;s condensed consolidated
financial statements have also been prepared on a basis substantially consistent with, and should
be read in conjunction with, the Company&#146;s consolidated financial statements for the year ended
December&nbsp;31, 2006, which were filed in the Company&#146;s Annual Report on Form 10-K with the Securities
and Exchange Commission (the &#147;SEC&#148;) on March&nbsp;12, 2007. The results of the Company&#146;s operations for
any interim period are not necessarily indicative of the results of the Company&#146;s operations for
any other interim period or for a full fiscal year.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The accompanying condensed consolidated financial statements reflect the operations of the
Company and its wholly-owned subsidiaries Alnylam U.S., Inc., Alnylam Europe AG and Alnylam
Securities Corporation. All significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Use of Estimates</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities
at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during
the reporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Certain reclassifications have been made to prior years&#146; financial statements to conform
to the 2007 presentation.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company accounts for and discloses net income (loss)&nbsp;per common share in accordance with
Statement of Financial Accounting Standard (&#147;SFAS&#148;) No.&nbsp;128 <I>&#147;Earnings per Share.&#148; </I>Basic net income
(loss)&nbsp;per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;attributable to common
stockholders by the weighted average number of common shares outstanding. Diluted net income (loss)
per common share is computed by dividing net income (loss)&nbsp;attributable to common stockholders by
the weighted average number of common shares and dilutive potential common share equivalents then
outstanding. Potential common shares consist of shares issuable upon the exercise of stock options
and warrants (using the treasury stock method), unvested restricted stock awards and the weighted
average conversion of the preferred stock into shares of common stock (using the if-converted
method) for periods prior to the Company&#146;s initial public offering, which was completed in June
2004. Because the inclusion of potential common stock would be anti-dilutive for all periods
presented, diluted net loss per share is the same as basic net loss per share.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The following table sets forth the potential common stock excluded from the calculation of net
loss per share because their inclusion would be anti-dilutive:

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Recent Accounting Pronouncements</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standard Board (&#147;FASB&#148;) issued SFAS No.&nbsp;157,
<I>&#147;Fair Value Measurements,&#148;</I> which addresses how companies should measure fair value when they are
required to do so for recognition or disclosure purposes. The standard provides a common definition
of fair value and is intended to make the measurement of fair value more consistent and comparable
as well as improving disclosures about those measures. The standard is effective for financial
statements for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. This standard formalizes the
measurement principles to be utilized in determining fair value for purposes such as derivative
valuation and impairment analysis. The Company is evaluating the implications of this
standard, but currently, does not expect it to have a significant impact on its consolidated
financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, <I>&#147;The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets
and Financial Liabilities-including an amendment of SFAS 115&#148; </I>(&#147;SFAS No.&nbsp;159&#148;). The new statement
allows entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and
liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a
company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that item&#146;s fair value in
subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No.&nbsp;159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. The Company is currently evaluating the potential
impact of SFAS No.&nbsp;159 on its consolidated financial statements.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>2. NOTES PAYABLE</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2006, the Company entered into an agreement with Oxford Finance Corporation
(&#147;Oxford&#148;) to establish an equipment line of credit for up to $7.0&nbsp;million to help support capital
expansion of the Company&#146;s facility in Cambridge, Massachusetts and capital equipment purchases.
The agreement allows the Company to draw down amounts under the line of credit through
December&nbsp;31, 2007 upon adherence to certain conditions. All borrowings under this line of credit
are collateralized by the assets financed and the agreement contains certain provisions that
restrict the Company&#146;s ability to dispose of or transfer these assets. During 2006, the Company
borrowed an aggregate of approximately $4.2&nbsp;million from Oxford pursuant to the agreement. Of such
amount, approximately $1.3&nbsp;million bears interest at fixed rates ranging from 10.1% to 10.4% and is
being repaid in 48&nbsp;monthly installments of principal and interest. The remainder of such amount,
approximately $2.9&nbsp;million, bears interest at fixed rates ranging from 10.0% to 10.4% and is being
repaid in 36&nbsp;monthly installments of principal and interest. As of March&nbsp;31, 2007, there was $3.3
million outstanding under this line of credit with Oxford.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2007, the Company borrowed an aggregate of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million from Oxford
pursuant to the agreement. Of such amount, approximately $0.6&nbsp;million bears interest at a fixed
rate of 10% and is being repaid in 48&nbsp;monthly installments of principal and interest. The remainder
of such amount, approximately $0.4&nbsp;million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 10% and is being
repaid in 36&nbsp;monthly installments of principal and interest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, the Company entered into an agreement with Lighthouse Capital Partners V, L.P.
(&#147;Lighthouse&#148;) to establish an equipment line of credit for $10.0&nbsp;million. All borrowings under the
line of credit are collateralized by the assets financed and the agreement contains certain
provisions that restrict the Company&#146;s ability to dispose of or transfer these assets. The
outstanding principal bears interest at a fixed rate of 9.25%, except for the drawdown made in
December&nbsp;2005, which bears interest at a fixed rate of 10.25%, maturing at various dates through
December&nbsp;2009. On the maturity of each equipment advance under the line of credit, the Company is
required to pay, in addition to the paid principal and interest, an additional amount of 11.5% of
the original principal. This amount is being accrued over the applicable borrowing period as
additional interest expense. As of March&nbsp;31, 2007, there was $5.1&nbsp;million outstanding under this
line of credit with Lighthouse.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt"><B><I>Novartis Broad Alliance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning in September&nbsp;2005, the Company entered into a series of transactions with Novartis
Pharma AG and its affiliate Novartis Institute for Biomedical
Research (collectively, &#147;Novartis&#148;).
In September&nbsp;2005, the Company and Novartis executed a stock purchase agreement (the &#147;Stock
Purchase Agreement&#148;) and an investor rights agreement (the &#147;Investor Rights Agreement&#148;). In October
2005, in connection with the closing of the transactions contemplated by the Stock Purchase
Agreement, the Investor Rights Agreement became effective and the Company and Novartis executed a
research collaboration and license agreement (the &#147;Collaboration and License Agreement&#148;)
(collectively, the &#147;Novartis Agreements&#148;).
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Stock Purchase Agreement, Novartis purchased 5,267,865 shares of the
Company&#146;s common stock for an aggregate purchase price of approximately $58.5&nbsp;million. Novartis
owned approximately 14% of the Company&#146;s outstanding common stock at March&nbsp;31, 2007.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the terms of the Collaboration and License Agreement, the parties will work together on
a defined number of selected targets, as defined in the Collaboration and License Agreement, to
discover and develop therapeutics based on RNA interference (&#147;RNAi&#148;). The Collaboration and License
Agreement has an initial term of three years and may be extended for two additional one-year terms
at the election of Novartis. Novartis made upfront payments totaling $10.0&nbsp;million to the Company
in October&nbsp;2005 and provides the Company with research funding and milestone payments as well
as royalties on annual net sales of products resulting from the Collaboration and License
Agreement. The Collaboration and License Agreement also provides Novartis with a non-exclusive
option to integrate the Company&#146;s intellectual property relating to certain RNAi technology into
Novartis&#146; operations under certain circumstances (the &#147;Integration Option&#148;). In connection with the
exercise of the Integration Option, Novartis will be required to make certain additional payments
to the Company.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company initially deferred the non-refundable $10.0&nbsp;million upfront payment and the $6.4
million premium received that represents the difference between the purchase price and the closing
price of the common stock of the Company on the date of the stock purchase from Novartis. These
payments, in addition to research funding and certain milestone payments, are recognized as revenue
using the proportional performance method over the estimated duration of the Novartis Agreements of
ten years. Under this model, the revenue recognized by the Company is limited to the amount of
non-refundable payments received or receivable to date. The Company updates its estimates of effort
remaining to complete its obligations under the agreements, the expected term of the agreements and
the expected total revenues when new information is known that could affect the Company&#146;s
estimates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B><I>Novartis Pandemic Flu Alliance</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2006, the Company entered into an alliance with Novartis for the development of
RNAi therapeutics for pandemic flu (the &#147;Novartis Flu Agreement&#148;). The Novartis Flu Agreement
supplements and, to the extent described therein, supersedes in
relevant part the Collaboration and
License Agreement for the broad Novartis alliance. Under the terms of the Novartis Flu Agreement,
the Company and Novartis have joint responsibility for development of RNAi therapeutics for
pandemic flu and Novartis provides funding for the research performed by the Company. Novartis will have primary responsibility for commercialization of such RNAi
therapeutics worldwide, but the Company will be actively involved, and may in certain circumstances
take the lead, in commercialization in the United States. The Company is eligible to receive
significant funding from Novartis for its efforts on RNAi therapeutics for pandemic flu, and to
receive a significant share of any
profits.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In July&nbsp;2006, the Company executed an Amended and Restated Research Collaboration and License
Agreement (the &#147;Amended License Agreement&#148;) with Merck &#038; Co., Inc. (&#147;Merck&#148;), which amends and
restates the Research Collaboration and License Agreement, dated September&nbsp;8, 2003, between the
Company and Merck, as amended (the &#147;Original License Agreement&#148;). The collaboration between the
Company and Merck is focused on developing RNAi therapeutics for targets associated with human
diseases and will focus on the nine targets that then remained to be nominated by Merck under the
terms of the Original License Agreement. These nine programs will be in addition to the existing
program directed to the NOGO pathway on which the Company and Merck are already collaborating. The
Company may select three of the nine additional programs as joint development programs, which Merck
will co-fund and participate in from the outset. In October&nbsp;2006, the Company selected a
co-development program from the first three targets presented by Merck under the Amended License
Agreement. The Amended License Agreement provides for funding from Merck immediately for programs
selected by the Company for co-development, and provides that, in the United States, the Company
will have the right to co-promote RNAi therapeutic products developed in these three co-development
programs. Merck will assume primary responsibility for the remaining six programs and the Company
is eligible to receive milestone payments and royalties on any RNAi therapeutic products developed
and commercialized by Merck in these six programs.

Idec Collaboration Agreement&#148;) with Biogen Idec, Inc. (&#147;Biogen Idec&#148;). The collaboration will
focus on the discovery and development of therapeutics based on RNAi for the potential treatment of
progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (&#147;PML&#148;). The Company and Biogen Idec will initially
conduct investigative research into the potential of RNAi technology to develop therapeutics to
treat PML. Under the terms of the Biogen Idec Collaboration Agreement, the Company granted Biogen
Idec an exclusive license to distribute, market and sell certain RNAi therapeutics to treat PML and
Biogen Idec has agreed to fund all related research and development activities. The Company also
received an upfront $5.0&nbsp;million payment from Biogen Idec. The Company is recognizing the remaining
deferred revenue using a proportional performance model over the period of expected performance of
five years. In addition, assuming the successful development and utilization of a product resulting
from the collaboration, Biogen Idec will be required to pay the
Company milestone and royalty payments.

with the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases (&#147;NIAID&#148;), a component of the
National Institutes of Health (&#147;NIH&#148;). The federal contract will provide the Company with up to
$23.0&nbsp;million in funding over a four-year period to develop RNAi therapeutics as anti-viral drugs
targeting the Ebola virus. The Ebola virus can cause a severe, often fatal infection, and poses a
potential biological safety risk and bioterrorism threat. Of the $23.0&nbsp;million in funding, the
government has committed to pay the Company up to $14.2&nbsp;million over the first two years of the
contract and, subject to the progress of the program and budgetary considerations in future years,
the remaining $8.8&nbsp;million over the last two years of the contract.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Company adopted the provisions of FASB Interpretation No.&nbsp;48 (&#147;FIN 48&#148;) on January&nbsp;1, 2007
&#147;<I>Accounting for Uncertainty in Income Taxes&#151;an interpretation of FASB Statement 109&#148; </I>which was
issued in July&nbsp;2006. The implementation of FIN 48 did not result in any adjustment to the Company&#146;s
beginning tax positions. The Company continues to fully recognize its tax benefits which are offset
by a valuation allowance to the extent that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets
will not be realized. At March&nbsp;31, 2007, the Company did not have any unrecognized tax benefits.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At
December&nbsp;31, 2006, the Company had federal and state net
operating loss (&#147;NOL&#148;) carryforwards of $54.6&nbsp;million
and $53.6&nbsp;million available, respectively, to reduce future
taxable income and which will expire at various dates beginning in
2008 through 2026. At December&nbsp;31, 2006, federal and state research
and development and other credit carryforwards were $2.3&nbsp;million
and $1.7&nbsp;million, respectively, available to reduce future tax
liabilities, and, which expire at various dates beginning in 2018
through 2026. Utilization of the NOL and research and development credit
carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to ownership change limitations
that have occurred previously or that could occur in the future provided by Section&nbsp;382 of the
Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as well as similar state and foreign provisions. These ownership
changes may limit the amount of NOL and research and development credit carryforwards that can be
utilized annually to offset future taxable income and tax, respectively. In general, an ownership
change, as defined by Section&nbsp;382, results from transactions increasing the ownership of certain
shareholders or public groups in the stock of a corporation by more than 50&nbsp;percentage points over
a three-year period. Since the Company&#146;s formation, the Company has raised capital through the
issuance of capital stock on several occasions (both pre and post initial public offering) which,
combined with the purchasing shareholders&#146; subsequent disposition of those shares, may have
resulted in a change of control, as defined by Section&nbsp;382, or could result in a change of control
in the future upon subsequent disposition. The Company has not currently completed a study to
assess whether a change of control has occurred or whether there have been multiple changes of
control since the Company&#146;s formation due to the significant complexity and cost associated with
such study. Any limitation may result in expiration of a portion of the NOL or research and
development credit carryforwards before utilization. Further, until a study is completed and any
limitation known, no amounts are being presented as an uncertain tax position under FIN 48.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 12pt"><B>Overview</B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are a biopharmaceutical company developing novel therapeutics based on RNA interference, or
RNAi. RNAi is a naturally occurring biological pathway within cells for selectively silencing and
regulating specific genes. Since many diseases are caused by the inappropriate activity of specific
genes, the ability to silence genes selectively through RNAi could provide a new way to treat a
wide range of human diseases. We believe that drugs that work through RNAi have the potential to
become a new major class of drugs, like small molecule, protein and antibody drugs. Using our
intellectual property and the expertise we have built in RNAi, we are developing a set of
biological and chemical methods and know-how that we expect to apply in a systematic way to develop
RNAi therapeutics for a variety of diseases.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are building a pipeline of RNAi therapeutics. Our lead program is in Phase I clinical
trials for the treatment of human respiratory syncytial virus, or RSV, infection, which we believe
is the leading cause of hospitalization in infants in the United States and occurs in the elderly
and in immune compromised adults. We submitted an investigational new drug, or IND, application for
ALN-RSV01 to the United States Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, in November&nbsp;2005, and
initiated Phase I clinical trials on this experimental drug in December&nbsp;2005 in both the United
States and Europe and presented results from these trials in April&nbsp;2006. ALN-RSV01 was found to be
safe and well tolerated when administered intranasally in these two Phase I clinical studies. In
October&nbsp;2006, we initiated a Phase I study with an inhaled formulation of ALN-RSV01, and in
November&nbsp;2006, we initiated a human experimental infection study with an RSV strain designed to
establish a safe and reliable RSV infection of the upper respiratory tract in adult volunteers. In
May&nbsp;2007, we presented results from this study that demonstrated the establishment of a safe and
reliable RSV infection in the upper respiratory tract of adult volunteers.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
pre-clinical development programs, we are also working on another
viral respiratory infection,
influenza, with Novartis, an RNAi therapeutic targeting a gene called PCSK9 for the treatment of
hypercholesterolemia and an RNAi therapeutic that is designed to target vascular endothelial growth
factor, or VEGF, and kinesin spindle protein, or KSP, for the
treatment of liver cancers and potentially other cancers. We have
pre-clinical discovery programs focused on central nervous system, or CNS, diseases including
Parkinson&#146;s disease, Huntington&#146;s disease, neuropathic pain, spinal cord injury and progressive
multifocal leukoencephalopathy, or PML, a CNS disease caused by viral infection in immune
compromised patients. We also have a program focused on the inherited respiratory disease known as
cystic fibrosis, or CF, as well as a program for Ebola virus infection. We are also working to
extend our capabilities to enable the development of RNAi therapeutics that travel through the
bloodstream to reach diseased parts of the body, which we refer to as Systemic
RNAi<FONT style="font-variant: SMALL-CAPS"><SUP style="font-size: 85%; vertical-align: text-top">tm</SUP></FONT>, and are developing technology to achieve efficient and safe systemic
delivery. In addition, we have formed alliances with leading companies, including Novartis Pharma
AG, or Novartis, Merck &#038; Co., Inc., or Merck, Biogen Idec, Inc., or Biogen Idec, and Medtronic,
Inc., or Medtronic.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We commenced operations in June&nbsp;2002. We have focused our efforts since inception primarily on
business planning, research and development, acquiring intellectual property rights, recruiting
management and technical staff, and raising capital. Since our inception, we have generated
significant losses. As of March&nbsp;31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $162.2&nbsp;million. Through
March&nbsp;31, 2007, we have funded our operations primarily through the net proceeds from the sale of
equity securities. Through March&nbsp;31, 2007, a substantial portion of our total net revenues have
been collaboration revenues derived from our strategic alliances with Novartis and Merck. We expect

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently have programs focused in a number of therapeutic areas, however, we are unable to
predict when, if ever, we will be able to commence sales of any product. We have not and may never
achieve profitability on a quarterly or annual basis and we expect to incur significant additional
losses over the next several years. We expect our net losses to increase primarily due to research
and development activities relating to our collaborations, drug development programs and other
general corporate activities. We anticipate that our operating results will fluctuate for the
foreseeable future. Therefore, period-to-period comparisons should not be relied upon as predictive
of the results in future periods. Our sources of potential funding for the next several years are
expected to include proceeds from the sale of equity, license and other fees, funded research and
development payments, proceeds from equipment lines of credit and milestone payments under existing
and future collaborative arrangements.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since our inception, we have focused on drug discovery and development programs. Research and
development expenses represent a substantial percentage of our total operating expenses. We have
initiated programs to identify specific RNAi therapeutics that will be administered directly to
diseased parts of the body, which we refer to as direct RNAi therapeutics, and we expect to
initiate additional programs as the capabilities of our product platform evolve. Included in our
current programs are development programs, those programs for which we have established targeted
timing for human clinical trials, and discovery programs, those programs for which we have yet to
establish programs for targeted timing for human clinical trials. All of our programs are in the
early stages of development. Our most advanced development program is focused on RSV, for which we
initiated human clinical trials in December&nbsp;2005. Our other development programs are focused on
another lung infection, influenza, or flu, the treatment of hypercholesterolemia and the treatment
of liver cancers and potentially other cancers. We also have discovery programs to develop direct RNAi therapeutics for the
treatment of the genetic respiratory disease CF; central nervous system disorders such as spinal
cord injury, Parkinson&#146;s disease, Huntington&#146;s disease, neuropathic pain; viral disease such as
Ebola; PML and several other diseases that are the subject of collaborations with Merck and
Novartis.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drug development and approval in the United States is a multi-step process regulated by the
FDA. The process begins with the filing of an IND application, which, if successful, allows the opportunity for
study in humans, or clinical study, of the new drug. Clinical development typically involves three
phases of study: Phase I, II and III. The most significant costs in clinical development are in
Phase III clinical trials, as they tend to be the longest and largest studies in the drug
development process. Following successful completion of Phase III clinical trials, a new drug
application, or NDA, must be submitted to, and accepted by, the FDA, and the FDA must approve the
NDA prior to commercialization of the drug.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There is a risk that any drug discovery and development program may not produce revenue
because of the risks inherent in drug discovery and development. Moreover, there are uncertainties
specific to any new field of drug discovery, including RNAi. The successful development of any
product candidate we develop is highly uncertain. Due to the numerous risks associated with
developing drugs, we cannot reasonably estimate or know the nature, timing and estimated costs of
the efforts necessary to complete the development of, or the period in which material net cash
inflows are expected to commence from, any potential product candidate. These risks include the
uncertainty of:

intellectual property to further our development efforts and to generate revenues. We have entered
into license agreements with Max Planck Innovation&nbsp;GmbH, or Max
Planck Innovation, and Isis Pharmaceuticals, Inc., or Isis, as well as a number of other entities,
to obtain rights to important intellectual property in the field of RNAi. We have entered into
collaborations with (1)&nbsp;Novartis to discover and develop therapeutics based on RNAi and to develop
an RNAi therapeutic for pandemic flu, (2)&nbsp;Merck to develop RNAi
technology and therapeutics, (3)&nbsp;Medtronic, which currently runs
through July 2007, to develop novel drug-device products incorporating RNAi therapeutics to treat diseases
caused by degeneration of the nervous system and (4)&nbsp;Biogen Idec to perform investigative research
into the potential of using RNAi technology to discover and develop therapeutics to treat PML. We
have also entered into contracts with government agencies, such as the National Institute of
Allergy and Infectious Diseases, or NIAID, a component of the National Institutes of Health, or
NIH. In addition, we have entered into an agreement with the Cystic
Fibrosis Foundation Therapeutics, Inc., or CFFT, to obtain funding and technical

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the table above, the increase in research and development expenses in
the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 as compared to the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006 was
primarily due to an increase in license fees, including a non-cash license fee of $7.9&nbsp;million and
a cash license fee of $0.4&nbsp;million related to the issuance of our stock to Tekmira during the first
quarter of 2007 in exchange for the worldwide exclusive license to Tekmira&#146;s liposomal delivery
formulation technology for the discovery, development, and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics,
as well as the expansion of the technology research and manufacturing alliance on lipid-based
delivery technology. The increase was also due to an increase in clinical trial expenses in
support of our clinical program for RSV infection related to our Phase I inhalation trial as well
as our experimental infection study. Also contributing to the increase were higher manufacturing
and external service costs associated with our pre-clinical programs for the treatment of
hypercholesterolemia and liver cancer as well as costs related to an increase in research and
development headcount over the past year to support our expanding pipeline and alliances. We
expect to continue to devote a substantial portion of our resources to research and development
expenses and that research and development expenses will increase as we continue development of our
and our collaborators&#146; product candidates and technologies.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not track most of our research and development costs or our personnel and
personnel-related costs on a project-by-project basis, because all of our programs are in the early
stages of development. However, our collaboration agreements contain cost sharing arrangements
whereby certain costs incurred under the project are reimbursed. Costs reimbursed under the
agreements typically include certain direct external costs and a negotiated full-time equivalent
labor rate for the actual time worked on the project. As a result, although a significant portion
of our research and development expenses are not tracked on a project-by-project basis, we do track
direct external costs attributable to, and the actual time our employees worked on, our
collaborations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As indicated in the table above, the increase in general and administrative expenses
during the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 as compared to the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006
was primarily due to higher professional service fees, which were the result of increased business
activities as well as higher costs supporting overall corporate growth.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest income was $2.7&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 and $1.3&nbsp;million
for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. The increase was due to our higher average cash, cash
equivalent and marketable securities balances due primarily to proceeds we received from our
December&nbsp;2006 public offering of common stock.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interest expense was $0.3&nbsp;million for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 and $0.2&nbsp;million
for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. Interest expense in each year related to borrowings
under our lines of credit used to finance capital equipment purchases. We expect that our interest
expense will increase as we finance additional capital expenditures.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since we commenced operations in June&nbsp;2002, we have generated significant losses. At
March&nbsp;31, 2007, we had an accumulated deficit of $162.2&nbsp;million. At March&nbsp;31, 2007, we had cash,
cash equivalents and marketable securities of $204.5&nbsp;million, compared to cash, cash equivalents
and marketable securities of $217.3&nbsp;million at December&nbsp;31, 2006. We invest primarily in cash
equivalents, U.S. government obligations, high-grade corporate notes and commercial paper. Our
investment objectives are, primarily, to assure liquidity and preservation of capital and,
secondarily, to obtain investment income. All of our investments in debt securities are recorded at
fair value and are available for sale. Fair value is determined based on quoted market prices.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<B><I>Operating activities</I></B>
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have required significant amounts of cash to fund our operating activities as a result of
net losses since our inception. This trend continued in the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 as
our use of cash in our operating activities increased as compared to the three months ended March
31, 2006. The main components of our use of cash in operating activities are the net loss and
changes in our operating assets and liabilities. Cash used in operating activities is adjusted for
non-cash items to reconcile net loss to net cash used in operating activities. These non-cash
adjustments primarily consist of non-cash license fees, stock-based compensation, depreciation and
amortization. We had an increase in accrued expenses of $2.8&nbsp;million for the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2007. Additionally, net accounts receivable and deferred revenue increased $0.6&nbsp;million
and $2.4&nbsp;million, respectively for the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007. Our cash utilization is
expected to continue for the remainder of 2007 and thereafter as we continue to develop and advance
our research and development initiatives. The actual amount of overall expenditures will depend on
numerous factors, including the timing of expenses, the timing and terms of collaboration
agreements or other strategic transactions, if any, and the timing and progress of our research and
development efforts.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007, net cash used in investing activities of $49.9
million resulted from net purchases of marketable securities of approximately $48.5&nbsp;million as well
as purchases of property and equipment of approximately $1.4&nbsp;million. For the three months ended
March&nbsp;31, 2006, net cash used in investing activities resulted from net sales of marketable
securities of approximately $11.2&nbsp;million, as well as purchases of property and equipment of
approximately $1.5&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the three months ended March&nbsp;31, 2007, net cash used in financing activities was $0.4
million compared to $62.5&nbsp;million of net cash provided by financing activities for the three months
ended March&nbsp;31, 2006. The change in net cash provided by financing activities was due to the net
proceeds of $62.2&nbsp;million from our follow-on public offering in January&nbsp;2006.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In
March&nbsp;2006, we entered into an agreement with Oxford Finance
Corporation, or Oxford, to establish an
equipment line of credit for up to $7.0&nbsp;million to help support capital expansion of our facility
in Cambridge, Massachusetts and capital equipment purchases. During 2006, we borrowed an aggregate
of $4.2&nbsp;million from Oxford pursuant to the agreement. Of such amount, $1.3&nbsp;million bears interest
at fixed rates ranging from 10.1% to 10.4% and is being repaid in 48&nbsp;monthly installments of
principal and interest. The remainder of

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In March&nbsp;2004, we entered into an equipment line of credit with Lighthouse Capital Partners to
finance leasehold improvements and equipment purchases of up to $10.0&nbsp;million. The outstanding
principal bears interest at a fixed rate of 9.25%, except for the drawdown made in December&nbsp;2005
which bears interest at a fixed rate of 10.25%, maturing at various dates through December&nbsp;2009. We
were required to make interest-only payments on all draw-downs made during the period from March
26, 2004 through June&nbsp;30, 2005, at which point all draw-downs began to be repaid over 48&nbsp;months. On
the maturity of each equipment advance under the line of credit, we are required to pay, in
addition to the paid principal and interest, an additional amount of 11.5% of the original
principal. This amount is being accrued over the applicable borrowing period as additional interest
expense. As of March&nbsp;31, 2007, we had an aggregate outstanding balance of $8.4&nbsp;million under all
our loan agreements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In May&nbsp;2007, we borrowed an aggregate of approximately $1.0&nbsp;million from Oxford pursuant to
the agreement. Of such amount, approximately $0.6&nbsp;million bears interest at a fixed rate of 10% and
is being repaid in 48&nbsp;monthly installments of principal and interest. The remainder of such amount,
approximately $0.4&nbsp;million, bears interest at a fixed rate of 10% and is being repaid in 36&nbsp;monthly
installments of principal and interest.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on our current operating plan, we believe that our existing resources, together with the
cash we expect to generate under our current alliances, will be sufficient to fund our planned
operations for at least the next several years, during which time we expect to further the
development of our products, extend the capabilities of our technology platform, conduct clinical
trials and continue to prosecute patent applications and otherwise build and maintain our patent
portfolio. However, we may require significant additional funds earlier than we currently expect in
order to develop, commence clinical trials for and commercialize any product candidates.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements and public or private
financings. Additional funding may not be available to us on acceptable terms or at all. In
addition, the terms of any financing may adversely affect the holdings or the rights of our
stockholders. For example, if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities, further
dilution to our existing stockholders may result. If we are unable to obtain funding on a timely
basis, we may be required to significantly curtail one or more of our research or development
programs. We also could be required to seek funds through arrangements with collaborators or others
that may require us to relinquish rights to some of our technologies or product candidates that we
would otherwise pursue.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if we are able to raise additional funds in a timely manner, our future capital
requirements may vary from what we expect and will depend on many factors, including the following:

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In September&nbsp;2006, the Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, issued Statement of
Financial Standards, or SFAS, No.&nbsp;157, Fair Value Measurements,
or SFAS No.&nbsp;157. SFAS No.&nbsp;157
clarifies the principle that fair value should be based on the assumptions market participants
would use when pricing an asset or liability and establishes a fair value hierarchy that
prioritizes the information used to develop those assumptions. Under the standard, fair value
measurements would be separately disclosed by level within the fair value hierarchy. SFAS No.&nbsp;157
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007,
and interim periods within those fiscal years, with early adoption
permitted. We are evaluating the implications of this standard, but
currently, we do not expect it to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In February&nbsp;2007, the FASB issued SFAS No.&nbsp;159, The Fair Value Option for Financial Assets and
Financial Liabilities-including an amendment of FAS 115, or SFAS No.&nbsp;159. The new statement allows
entities to choose, at specified election dates, to measure eligible financial assets and
liabilities at fair value that are not otherwise required to be measured at fair value. If a
company elects the fair value option for an eligible item, changes in that item&#146;s fair value in
subsequent reporting periods must be recognized in current earnings. SFAS No.&nbsp;159 is effective for
fiscal years beginning after November&nbsp;15, 2007. We are evaluating the potential impact of
SFAS No.&nbsp;159 on our consolidated financial statements.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As part of our investment portfolio, we own financial instruments that are sensitive to market
risks. The investment portfolio is used to preserve our capital until it is required to fund
operations, including our research and development activities. Our marketable securities consist of
U.S. government obligations, corporate debt and commercial paper. All of our investments in debt
securities are classified as &#147;available-for-sale&#148; and are recorded at fair value. Our
&#147;available-for-sale&#148; investments are sensitive to changes in interest rates. Interest rate changes
would result in a change in the net fair value of these financial instruments due to the difference
between the market interest rate and the market interest rate at the date of purchase of the
financial instrument. A 10% decrease in market interest rates at March&nbsp;31, 2007 would impact the
net fair value of such interest-sensitive financial instruments by approximately $0.7&nbsp;million.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk. Our European operations are based in
Kulmbach, Germany and the functional currency of these operations is the Euro. We provide funding
to our European operations to pay for obligations denominated in Euros. The effect that
fluctuations in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States Dollar have on the amounts
payable to fund our European operations are recorded in our consolidated statements of operations
as other income or expense. We do not enter into any foreign exchange hedge contracts.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Assuming the amount of expenditures by our European operations were consistent with 2006 and
the timing of the funding of these operations were to remain consistent during the remainder of
2007, a constant increase or decrease in the exchange rate between the Euro and the United States
Dollar during the remainder of 2007 of 10% would result in a foreign exchange gain or loss of
approximately $0.1&nbsp;million.

</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and vice president of
finance and treasurer, evaluated the effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures as of
March&nbsp;31, 2007. The term &#147;disclosure controls and procedures,&#148; as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a-15(e) and
15d-15(e) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, or the Exchange Act, means controls and other
procedures of a company that are designed to ensure that information required to be disclosed by a
company in the reports that it files or submits under the Exchange Act is recorded, processed,
summarized and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC&#146;s rules and forms. Disclosure
controls and procedures include, without limitation, controls and procedures designed to ensure
that information required to be disclosed by a company in the reports that it files or submits
under the Exchange Act is accumulated and communicated to the company&#146;s management, including its
principal executive and principal financial officers, as appropriate to allow timely decisions
regarding required disclosure. Management recognizes that any controls and procedures, no matter
how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving their objectives
and management necessarily applies its judgment in evaluating the cost-benefit relationship of
possible controls and procedures. Based on the evaluation of our disclosure controls and procedures
as of March&nbsp;31, 2007, our chief executive officer and vice president of finance and treasurer
concluded that, as of such date, our disclosure controls and procedures were effective at the
reasonable assurance level.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No change in our internal control over financial reporting (as defined in Rules&nbsp;13a&#150;15(d) and
15d&#150;15(d) under the Exchange Act) occurred during the fiscal quarter ended March&nbsp;31, 2007 that has
materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control over
financial reporting.

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have concentrated our efforts and therapeutic product research on RNAi technology, and our
future success depends on the successful development of this technology and products based on RNAi
technology. Neither we nor any other company has received regulatory approval to market
therapeutics utilizing small interfering RNAs, or siRNAs, the class of molecule we are trying to
develop into drugs. The scientific discoveries that form the basis for our efforts to discover and
develop new drugs are relatively new. The scientific evidence to support the feasibility of
developing drugs based on these discoveries is both preliminary and limited. Skepticism as to the
feasibility of developing RNAi therapeutics has been expressed in scientific literature. For
example, there are potential challenges to achieving safe RNAi therapeutics based on the so-called
off-target effects and activation of the interferon response. There are also potential challenges
to achieving effective RNAi therapeutics based on the need to achieve efficient delivery into cells
and tissues in a clinically relevant manner and at doses that are cost-effective.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very few drug candidates based on these discoveries have ever been tested in animals or
humans. siRNAs may not naturally possess the inherent properties typically required of drugs, such
as the ability to be stable in the body long enough to reach the tissues in which their effects are
required, nor the ability to enter cells within these tissues in order to exert their effects. We

drug-like properties into siRNAs. We may spend large amounts of money trying to introduce these
properties, and may never succeed in doing so. In addition, these compounds may not demonstrate in
patients the chemical and pharmacological properties ascribed to them in laboratory studies, and
they may interact with human biological systems in unforeseen, ineffective or harmful ways. As a
result, we may never succeed in developing a marketable product. If we do not successfully develop
and commercialize drugs based upon our technological approach, we may not become profitable and the
value of our common stock will decline.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Further, our focus solely on RNAi technology for developing drugs as opposed to multiple, more
proven technologies for drug development, increases the risks associated with the ownership of our
common stock. If we are not successful in developing a product candidate using RNAi technology, we
may be required to change the scope and direction of our product development activities. In that
case, we may not be able to identify and implement successfully an alternative product development
strategy.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have experienced significant operating losses since our inception. As of March&nbsp;31, 2007, we
had an accumulated deficit of $162.2&nbsp;million. To date, we have not developed any products nor
generated any revenues from the sale of products. Further, we do not expect to generate any such
revenues in the foreseeable future. We expect to continue to incur annual net operating losses over
the next several years as we expand our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi
therapeutics. We anticipate that the majority of any revenue we generate over the next several
years will be from collaborations with pharmaceutical companies or funding from contracts with the
government, but cannot be certain that we will be able to secure or maintain these collaborations
or contracts or to meet the obligations or achieve any milestones that we may be required to meet
or achieve to receive payments. If we are unable to secure revenue from collaborations, we may be
unable to continue our efforts to discover, develop and commercialize RNAi therapeutics without
raising financing from other sources.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To become and remain profitable, we must succeed in developing and commercializing novel drugs
with significant market potential. This will require us to be successful in a range of challenging
activities, including pre-clinical testing and clinical trial stages of development, obtaining
regulatory approval for these novel drugs, and manufacturing, marketing and selling them. We may
never succeed in these activities, and may never generate revenues that are significant enough to
achieve profitability. Even if we do achieve profitability, we may not be able to sustain or
increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis. If we cannot become and remain profitable,
the market price of our common stock could decline. In addition, we may be unable to raise capital,
expand our business, diversify our product offerings or continue our operations.

clinical milestones as well as royalties on the annual net sales of any products derived from this
collaboration. This collaboration has an initial term of three years that may be extended by
Novartis for two additional one-year terms. Novartis may elect to terminate this collaboration
after two years under some circumstances or in the event of a material uncured breach by us. We
expect that a substantial amount of the funding for our operations will come from this
collaboration. If this collaboration is unsuccessful, or if it is terminated, our business could be
adversely affected.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This agreement also provides Novartis with a non-exclusive option to integrate our
intellectual property into Novartis&#146; operations and develop products without our involvement for a
pre-determined fee. If Novartis elects to exercise this option, Novartis could become a competitor
of ours in the development of RNAi-based drugs targeting the same diseases. Novartis has
significantly greater financial resources than we do and has far more experience in developing and
marketing drugs, which could put us at a competitive disadvantage if we were to compete with
Novartis in the development of RNAi-based drugs targeting the same disease. The exercise by
Novartis of this option could adversely affect our business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We do not have any capability for sales, marketing or distribution and have limited
capabilities for drug development. Accordingly, we have entered into alliances with other companies
that can provide such capabilities and may need to enter into additional alliances in the future.
For example, we may enter into alliances with major pharmaceutical companies to jointly develop
specific drug candidates and to jointly commercialize them if they are approved. In such alliances,
we would expect our pharmaceutical collaborators to provide substantial capabilities in clinical
development, regulatory affairs, marketing and sales. We may not be successful in entering into any
such alliances on favorable terms due to various factors including Novartis&#146; right of first offer.
Even if we do succeed in securing such alliances, we may not be able to maintain them if, for
example, development or approval of a drug candidate is delayed or sales of an approved drug are
disappointing. Furthermore, any delay in entering into collaboration agreements could delay the
development and commercialization of our drug candidates and reduce their competitiveness even if
they reach the market. Any such delay related to our collaborations could adversely affect our
business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For certain drug candidates that we may develop, we have formed collaborations to fund all or
part of the costs of drug development and commercialization, such as our collaborations with
Novartis, as well as collaborations with Merck, Medtronic, Biogen Idec and the NIAID, a component
of the NIH. We may not, however, be able to enter into additional collaborations, and the terms of
any collaboration agreement we do secure may not be favorable to us. If we are not successful in
our efforts to enter into future collaboration arrangements with respect to a particular drug
candidate, we may not have sufficient funds to develop this or any other drug candidate internally,
or to bring any drug candidates to market. If we do not have sufficient funds to develop and bring
our drug candidates to market, we will not be able to generate sales revenues from these drug
candidates, and this will substantially harm our business.

adversely affected if any collaborator terminates its collaboration agreement with us or fails to
perform its obligations under that agreement. Our current or future collaborations, if any, may not
be scientifically or commercially successful. Disputes may arise in the future with respect to the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have very limited manufacturing experience. Our internal manufacturing capabilities are
limited to small-scale production of non-good manufacturing practice material for use in <I>in vitro</I>

such as liposomes, whose scale-up and manufacturing could also be very difficult. We also have very
limited experience in such scale-up and manufacturing, requiring us to depend on third parties, who
might not be able to deliver at all or in a timely manner. In order to develop products, apply for
regulatory approvals and commercialize our products, we will need to develop, contract for, or
otherwise arrange for the necessary manufacturing capabilities. We may manufacture clinical trial
materials ourselves or we may rely on others to manufacture the materials we will require for any
clinical trials that we initiate. Only a limited number of manufacturers supply synthetic RNAi. We
currently rely on several contract manufacturers for our supply of synthetic RNAi. There are risks
inherent in pharmaceutical manufacturing that could affect the ability of our contract
manufacturers to meet our delivery time requirements or provide adequate amounts of material to
meet our needs. Included in these risks are synthesis and purification failures and contamination
during the manufacturing process, both of which could result in unusable product and cause delays
in our development process. In addition, to fulfill our RNAi requirements we may need to secure
alternative suppliers of synthetic RNAi. The manufacturing process for any products that we may
develop is an element of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, or FDA, approval process and we
will need to contract with manufacturers who can meet all applicable FDA requirements on an ongoing
basis. In addition, if we receive the necessary regulatory approval for any product candidate, we
also expect to rely on third parties, including our commercial collaborators, to produce materials
required for commercial production. We may experience difficulty in obtaining adequate

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials of a new drug candidate require the enrollment of a sufficient number of
patients, including patients who are suffering from the disease the drug candidate is intended to
treat and who meet other eligibility criteria. Rates of patient enrollment are affected by many
factors, including the size of the patient population, the age and condition of the patients, the
nature of the protocol, the proximity of patients to clinical sites, the availability of effective
treatments for the relevant disease and the eligibility criteria for the clinical trial. Delays in
patient enrollment can result in increased costs and longer development times.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Clinical trials also require the review and oversight of IRBs, which approve and continually
review clinical investigations and protect the rights and welfare of human subjects. Inability to
obtain or delay in obtaining IRB approval can prevent or delay the initiation and completion of
clinical trials, and the FDA may decide not to consider any data or information derived from a
clinical investigation not subject to initial and continuing IRB review and approval in support of
a marketing application.

financial resources to continue development of the drug candidate that is affected, or development
of any of our other drug candidates. We may also lose, or be unable to enter into, collaborative

</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some drug candidates that we develop may need to be administered using specialized drug
delivery devices that deliver RNAi therapeutics directly to diseased parts of the body. We believe
that any product candidate we develop for Parkinson&#146;s disease, or PD, Huntington&#146;s disease, or HD,
or other central nervous system diseases may need to be administered using such a device. For
neurodegenerative diseases, we have entered into a collaboration agreement with Medtronic to pursue
potential development of drug-device combinations incorporating RNAi therapeutics. We may not
achieve successful development results under this collaboration and may need to seek other
collaboration partners to develop alternative drug delivery systems, or utilize existing drug
delivery systems, for the direct delivery of RNAi therapeutics for these diseases. While we expect
to rely on drug delivery systems that have been approved by the FDA or other regulatory agencies to
deliver drugs like ours to similar physiological sites, we, or our collaborator, may need to modify
the design or labeling of such delivery device for some products we may develop. In such an event,
the FDA may regulate the product as a combination product or require additional approvals or
clearances for the modified delivery device. Further, to the extent the specialized delivery device
is owned by another company, we would need that company&#146;s cooperation to implement the necessary
changes to the device, or its labeling, and to obtain any additional approvals or clearances. In
cases where we do not have an ongoing collaboration with the company that makes the device,
obtaining such additional approvals or clearances and the cooperation of such other company could
significantly delay and increase the cost of obtaining marketing approval, which could reduce the
commercial viability of our drug candidate. In summary, we may be unable to find, or experience
delays in finding, suitable drug delivery systems to administer RNAi therapeutics directly to
diseased parts of the body, which could negatively affect our ability to successfully commercialize
these RNAi therapeutics.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our drug candidates are subject to extensive governmental regulations relating to, among other
things, research, testing, development, manufacturing, safety, efficacy, recordkeeping, labeling,
marketing and distribution of drugs. Rigorous pre-clinical testing and clinical trials and an
extensive regulatory approval process are required to be successfully completed in the United
States and in many foreign jurisdictions before a new drug can be sold. Satisfaction of these and
other regulatory requirements is costly, time consuming, uncertain and subject to unanticipated
delays. It is possible that none of the drug candidates we may develop will obtain the appropriate
regulatory approvals necessary for us or our collaborators to begin selling them.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have very little experience in conducting and managing the clinical trials necessary to
obtain regulatory approvals, including approval by the FDA. The time required to obtain FDA and
other approvals is unpredictable but typically takes many years following the commencement of
clinical trials, depending upon the complexity of the drug candidate. Any analysis we perform of
data from pre-clinical and clinical activities is subject to confirmation and interpretation by
regulatory authorities, which could delay, limit or prevent regulatory approval. We may also
encounter unexpected delays or increased costs due to new government regulations, for example, from
future legislation or administrative action, or from changes in FDA policy during the period of
product development, clinical trials and FDA regulatory review.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the drugs we are intending to develop may represent a new class of drug, the FDA has

product candidates that we develop will be regulated as a new drug under the Federal Food, Drug,
and Cosmetic Act, the FDA could decide to regulate them or other products we may develop as
biologics under the Public Health Service Act. The lack of policies, practices or guidelines may
hinder or slow review by the FDA of any regulatory filings that we may submit. Moreover, the FDA
may respond to these submissions by defining requirements we may not have anticipated. Such
responses could lead to significant delays in the clinical development of our product candidates.
In addition, because there may be approved treatments for some of the diseases for which we may
seek approval, in order to receive regulatory approval, we will need to demonstrate through
clinical trials that the product candidates we develop to treat these diseases, if any, are not
only safe and effective, but safer or more effective than existing products.

our ability to generate revenues from the particular drug candidate. Furthermore, any regulatory
approval to market a product may be subject to limitations on the indicated uses for which we may
market the product. These limitations may limit the size of the market for the product and affect
reimbursement by third-party payors.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We are also subject to numerous foreign regulatory requirements governing the conduct of
clinical trials, manufacturing and marketing authorization, pricing and third-party reimbursement.
The foreign regulatory approval process includes all of the risks associated with FDA approval
described above as well as risks attributable to the satisfaction of local regulations in foreign
jurisdictions. Approval by the FDA does not assure approval by regulatory authorities outside the
United States.

difficult to design and implement, can take many years to complete and is uncertain as to outcome.

trials will be successful, and interim results of a clinical trial do not necessarily predict final
results.

to those we are targeting, any product candidate that we develop may not be effective against that
virus. Accordingly, while we expect that any RNAi therapeutic we develop for the treatment of
pandemic flu could be stockpiled by governments as part of their preparations for a flu pandemic,
they may not elect to purchase such product.

reimbursement practices or healthcare reform initiatives, thereby harming our business.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The regulations that govern marketing approvals, pricing and reimbursement for new drugs vary
widely from country to country. Some countries require approval of the sale price of a drug before
it can be marketed. In many countries, the pricing review period begins after marketing or product
licensing approval is granted. In some foreign markets, prescription pharmaceutical pricing remains
subject to continuing governmental control even after initial approval is granted. Although we
intend to monitor these regulations, our programs are currently in the early stages of development
and we will not be able to assess the impact of price regulations for a number of years. As a
result, we might obtain regulatory approval for a product in a particular country, but then be
subject to price regulations that delay our commercial launch of the product and negatively impact
the revenues we are able to generate from the sale of the product in that country.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our ability to commercialize any products successfully also will depend in part on the extent
to which reimbursement for these products and related treatments will be available from government
health administration authorities, private health insurers and other organizations. Even if we
succeed in bringing one or more products to the market, these products may not be considered
cost-effective, and the amount reimbursed for any products may be insufficient to allow us to sell
our products on a competitive basis. Because our programs are in the early stages of development,
we are unable at this time to determine their cost effectiveness and the level or method of
reimbursement. Increasingly, the third-party payors who reimburse patients, such as government and
private insurance plans, are requiring that drug companies provide them with predetermined
discounts from list prices, and are challenging the prices charged for medical products. If the
price we are able to charge for any products we develop is inadequate in light of our development
and other costs, our profitability could be adversely affected.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We currently expect that any drugs we develop may need to be administered under the

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There may be significant delays in obtaining coverage for newly-approved drugs, and coverage
may be more limited than the purposes for which the drug is approved by the FDA. Moreover,
eligibility for coverage does not imply that any drug will be reimbursed in all cases or at a rate
that covers our costs, including research, development, manufacture, sale and distribution. Interim
payments for new drugs, if applicable, may also not be sufficient to cover our costs and may not be
made permanent. Reimbursement may be based on payments allowed for lower-cost drugs that are
already reimbursed, may be incorporated into existing payments for other services and may reflect
budgetary constraints or imperfections in Medicare data. Net prices for drugs may be reduced by
mandatory discounts or rebates required by government health care programs or private payors and by
any future relaxation of laws that presently restrict imports of drugs from countries where they
may be sold at lower prices than in the United States. Third party payors often rely upon Medicare
coverage policy and payment limitations in setting their own reimbursement rates. Our inability to
promptly obtain coverage and profitable reimbursement rates from both government-funded and private
payors for new drugs that we develop could have a material adverse effect on our operating results,
our ability to raise capital needed to commercialize products, and our overall financial condition.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We believe that the efforts of governments and third-party payors to contain or reduce the
cost of healthcare will continue to affect the business and financial condition of pharmaceutical
and biopharmaceutical companies. A number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the
healthcare system in the United States and other major healthcare markets have been proposed in
recent years. These proposals have included prescription drug benefit legislation recently enacted
in the United States and healthcare reform legislation recently enacted by certain states. Further
federal and state legislative and regulatory developments are possible and we expect ongoing
initiatives in the United States to increase pressure on drug pricing. Such reforms could have an
adverse effect on anticipated revenues from drug candidates that we may successfully develop.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Another development that may affect the pricing of drugs is Congressional action regarding
drug reimportation into the United States. The Medicare Prescription Drug Plan legislation, which
became law in December&nbsp;2003, required the Secretary of Health and Human Services to promulgate
regulations for drug reimportation from Canada into the United States under some circumstances,
including when the drugs are sold at a lower price than in the United States. The Secretary,
however, retained the discretion not to implement a drug reimportation plan if he finds that the
benefits do not outweigh the costs, and has so far declined to approve a reimportation plan.
Proponents of drug reimportation may attempt to pass legislation that would directly allow
reimportation under certain circumstances. Legislation or regulations allowing the reimportation of
drugs, if enacted, could decrease the price we receive for any products that we may develop,
negatively affecting our anticipated revenues and prospects for profitability.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some states and localities have established drug importation programs for their citizens, and
federal drug import legislation has been introduced in Congress. The FDA has warned that imported
drugs may be unsafe or illegal. If such programs become more widespread or the federal government
changes its position against drug importation, prices we receive for any products that we may
develop may decrease, negatively affecting our anticipated revenues and prospects for
profitability.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt; margin-left: 1%"><B><I>There is a substantial risk of product liability claims in our business. If we are unable to obtain
sufficient insurance, a product liability claim against us could adversely affect our business.</I></B>
</DIV>

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our business exposes us to significant potential product liability risks that are inherent in
the development, manufacturing and marketing of human therapeutic products. Product liability
claims could delay or prevent completion of our clinical development programs. If we succeed in
marketing products, such claims could result in an FDA investigation of the safety and
effectiveness of our products, our manufacturing processes and facilities or our marketing
programs, and potentially a recall of our products or more serious enforcement action, limitations
on the indications for which they may be used, or suspension or withdrawal of approvals. We
currently have product liability insurance that we believe is appropriate for our stage of
development and may need to obtain higher levels prior to marketing any of our drug candidates. Any
insurance we have or may obtain may not provide sufficient coverage against potential liabilities.
Furthermore, clinical trial and product liability insurance is becoming increasingly expensive. As
a result, we may be unable to obtain sufficient insurance at a reasonable cost to protect us
against losses caused by product liability claims that could have a material adverse effect on our
business.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to the competition we face from competing drugs in general, we also face
competition from other companies working to develop novel drugs using technology that competes more
directly with our own. We are aware of several other companies that are working in the field of
RNAi, including Sirna, a subsidiary of Merck, Opko, Nastech, Calando, Quark, Nucleonics, Silence
Therapeutics, RXi, a subsidiary of CytRx, Inc., Protiva and Intradigm. In addition, we granted
licenses to Isis, GeneCare, Benitec, Nastech, Calando, Quark as well as others under which these
companies may independently develop RNAi therapeutics against a limited number of targets. Any of
these companies may develop its RNAi technology more rapidly and more effectively than us. Merck is
currently one of our collaborators and a licensee under our intellectual property for specified
disease targets. However, as a result of its acquisition of Sirna in December&nbsp;2006, Merck, which
has substantially more resources and experience in developing drugs than we do, could become a
direct competitor.
</DIV>


<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We also compete with companies working to develop antisense-based drugs. Like RNAi product
candidates, antisense drugs target mRNAs in order to suppress the activity of specific genes. Isis
is currently marketing an antisense drug and has several antisense drug candidates in clinical
trials, and another company, Genta Inc., has multiple antisense drug candidates in late-stage
clinical trials. The development of antisense drugs is more advanced than that of RNAi
therapeutics, and antisense technology may become the preferred technology for drugs that target
mRNAs to silence specific genes.

that we develop under the patent and other intellectual property laws of the United States and
other countries, so that we can prevent others from unlawfully using our inventions and proprietary

commercialize our proposed products. Because certain U.S. patent applications are confidential
until patents issue, such as applications filed prior to November&nbsp;29, 2000, or applications filed
after such date which will not be filed in foreign countries, third parties may have filed patent
applications for technology covered by our pending patent applications without our being aware of
those applications, and our patent applications may not have priority over those applications. For
this and other reasons, we may be unable to secure desired patent rights, thereby losing desired
exclusivity. Further, we may be required to obtain licenses under third-party patents to market our
proposed products or conduct our research and development or other activities. If licenses are not
available to us on acceptable terms, we will not be able to market the affected products or conduct
the desired activities.

circumvented. Moreover, the USPTO, may commence interference proceedings involving our patents or
patent applications. Any challenge to, finding of unenforceability or invalidation or circumvention

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our pending patent applications may not result in issued patents. The patent position of
pharmaceutical or biotechnology companies, including ours, is generally uncertain and involves
complex legal and factual considerations. The standards that the USPTO and its foreign counterparts
use to grant patents are not always applied predictably or uniformly and can change. There is also
no uniform, worldwide policy regarding the subject matter and scope of claims granted or allowable
in pharmaceutical or biotechnology patents. Accordingly, we do not know the degree of future
protection for our proprietary rights or the breadth of claims that will be allowed in any patents
issued to us or to others.

applications to which we are licensed. Even if patents issue in respect of these patent
applications, our licensors may fail to maintain these patents, may determine not to pursue
litigation against other companies that are infringing these patents, or may pursue such litigation

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RNA interference is a relatively new scientific field that has generated many different patent
applications from organizations and individuals seeking to obtain important patents in the field.
These applications claim many different methods, compositions and processes relating to the
discovery, development and commercialization of RNAi therapeutics. Because the field is so new,
very few of these patent applications have been fully processed by government patent offices around
the world, and there is a great deal of uncertainty about which patents will issue, when, to whom,
and with what claims. It is likely that there will be significant litigation and other proceedings,
such as interference and opposition proceedings in various patent offices, relating to patent
rights in the RNAi field. Others may attempt to invalidate our intellectual property rights. Even
if our rights are not directly challenged, disputes among third parties could lead to the weakening
or invalidation of our intellectual property rights. Any attempt to circumvent or invalidate our
intellectual property rights would be costly, would require significant time and attention of our

chemistry that we may need to apply to our siRNA drug candidates. There are also many issued
patents that claim genes or portions of genes that may be relevant for siRNA drugs we wish to
develop. Thus, it is possible that one or more organizations will hold patent rights to which we
will need a license. If those organizations refuse to grant us a license to such patent rights on
reasonable terms, we will not be able to market products or perform research and development or
other activities covered by these patents.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Third parties may sue us for infringing their patent rights. Likewise, we may need to resort
to litigation to enforce a patent issued or licensed to us or to determine the scope and validity
of proprietary rights of others. In addition, a third party may claim that we have improperly
obtained or used its confidential or proprietary information. Furthermore, in connection with a
license agreement, we have agreed to indemnify the licensor for costs incurred in connection with
litigation relating to intellectual property rights. The cost to us of any litigation or other
proceeding relating to intellectual property rights, even if resolved in our favor, could be
substantial, and the litigation would divert our management&#146;s efforts. Some of our competitors may
be able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation more effectively than we can because they
have substantially greater resources. Uncertainties resulting from the initiation and continuation
of any litigation could limit our ability to continue our operations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If any parties successfully claim that our creation or use of proprietary technologies
infringes upon their intellectual property rights, we might be forced to pay damages, potentially
including treble damages, if we are found to have willfully infringed on such parties&#146; patent
rights. In addition to any damages we might have to pay, a court could require us to stop the
infringing activity or obtain a license. Any license required under any patent may not be made
available on commercially acceptable terms, if at all. In addition, such licenses are likely to be
non-exclusive and, therefore, our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to
us. If we fail to obtain a required license and are unable to design around a patent, we may be
unable to effectively market some of our technology and products, which could limit our ability to
generate revenues or achieve profitability and possibly prevent us from generating revenue
sufficient to sustain our operations. Moreover, we expect that a number of our collaborations will
provide that royalties payable to us for licenses to our intellectual property may be offset by
amounts paid by our collaborators to third parties who have competing or superior intellectual
property positions in the relevant fields, which could result in significant reductions in our
revenues from products developed through collaborations.

<DIV align="left" style="font-size: 10pt; margin-top: 6pt">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Our current licenses impose, and any future licenses we enter into are likely to impose,
various development, commercialization, funding, royalty, diligence, sublicensing, insurance and
other obligations on us. If we breach any of these obligations, the licensor may have the right to
terminate the license or render the license non-exclusive, which could result in us being unable to
develop, manufacture and sell products that are covered by the licensed technology or enable a
competitor to gain access to the licensed technology. In addition, while we cannot currently
determine the amount of the royalty obligations we will be required to pay on sales of future
products, if any, the amounts may be significant. The amount of our future royalty obligations will
depend on the technology and intellectual property we use in products that we successfully develop

we may be unable to achieve or maintain profitability.

minimum level of employees in Germany. If we fail to comply with this condition, the owners of the
patents that are the subject of these licenses may have the right to grant a similar license to one
other company. We regard these patents as significant because they relate to important aspects of
the structure of siRNA
