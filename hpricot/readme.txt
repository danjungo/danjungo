This directory contains two roots of rails.

hp12 contains my initial efforts with hpricot.com

It allows you to build, pipeline, and save hpricot expressions.

Most users disliked its confusing nature.

hp14 offers a much simpler UI.

hp14 offers no ability to register or save data.

Much to my delight, a copy of hp14 is still running here:

http://hpricot.com

(As of 2011-07-15)

The domain will expire in 2012 at which point hp14 will be found here:
